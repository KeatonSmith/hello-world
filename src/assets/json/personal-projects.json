    "description": "This is the site you are currently on! This was initially made to be a testing ground for me to learn how to use DevOps tools and practices, but evolved into a place for me to document my career and personal projects. I wrote this using Angular 9 and have it set up with a full DevOps pipeline using AWS cloud infrastructure. I have Jenkins sitting on an EC2 instance that tests and deploys this site to an S3 bucket with every push I make to GitHub. \n This has been a fun project to excercise my web-dev muscles.",
